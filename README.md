## Day 1
### Hula Hoops
- We used hula-hoops to delineate two areas of interest outdoors (we'll call these areas "Area 50" and "Area 51")
- Area 50 was very moist and semi-shaded beneath some tall trees.  We observed many biotic elements, including crab grass, wild flowers, dandelions, ivy, pieces of bark and dead leaves, ants, a spider web, and some seeds.  The tallest growth was about 10cm high.  We also noted an abiotic element, a blue, plastic wire nut.
- Area 51 was less shadded and less moist.  Here, we observed many grasses, vines, dandelions, and wildflowers, along with evidence of worms.  We also watched a tiny, bee-like creature hovering near the flowers.  The tallest growth here was 19cm high.

### Mysterious Tracks
- We used clay to capture a print of a mysterious track and are now waiting for the plaster to dry.  What could it be?

### Biome in a Cube
- We created our own biomes in a small plastic cube (jar).  Along with gravel, activated charcoal, and moss I placed onion seeds and radish seeds inside.  I wonder what will grow?
- We discussed the geology of Texas.  I was surprised to learn that the species in any given area is utlimately related to the underlying bedrock.

## Day 2
### Amphibians
- Amphibians.  And more Amphibians.  There are over 8,013 species of Amphibians.
- A frogs toungue is attached at the front rather than the back so it can "flip out".
- Amphibians are "ectothermic" - cold-blooded
- Goliath frogs are very large!
