## Day 1
### Hula Hoops
- We used hula-hoops to delineate two areas of interest outdoors (we'll call these areas "Area 50" and "Area 51")
- Area 50 was very moist and semi-shaded beneath some tall trees.  We observed many biotic elements, including crab grass, wild flowers, dandelions, ivy, pieces of bark and dead leaves, ants, a spider web, and some seeds.  The tallest growth was about 10cm high.  We also noted an abiotic element, a blue, plastic wire nut.
- Area 51 was less shadded and less moist.  Here, we observed many grasses, vines, dandelions, and wildflowers, along with evidence of worms.  We also watched a tiny, bee-like creature hovering near the flowers.  The tallest growth here was 19cm high.

### Mysterious Tracks
- We used clay to capture a print of a mysterious track and are now waiting for the plaster to dry.  What could it be?

### Biome in a Cube
- We created our own biomes in a small plastic cube (jar).  Along with gravel, activated charcoal, and moss I placed onion seeds and radish seeds inside.  I wonder what will grow?
- We discussed the geology of Texas.  I was surprised to learn that the species in any given area is utlimately related to the underlying bedrock.

## Day 2
### Amphibians
- Amphibians.  And more Amphibians.  There are over 8,013 species of Amphibians.
- A frogs toungue is attached at the front rather than the back so it can "flip out".
- Amphibians are "ectothermic" - cold-blooded
- Goliath frogs are very large!

### iNaturalist
- A very cool application for documenting and identifying nature

### Species by Major Groups
- https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/summary-statistics
- There are 11,126 species of birds
- There are 10,793 species of reptiles
- There are over 1,000,000 species of insects!!!
- There are 102,248 species of arachnids
- There are 2,175 species of corals
- There are 80,325 species of mollusks
- There are 268,000 species of angiosperms (flowering plants)

### Scat Studies
- Perhaps a coyote (based on seeing seeds, insects, trash, and animal parts in the scat, assumed omnivore, fairly large)
- Tracks match our hypothesis
- Skull also matches
- It was a coyote!

### Ask Nature (asknature.org)
- Biomimicry
- Inspiration from nature to solve real-world problems

### Involve Me and I Learn - PBL's
- "PBL" - Project Based Learning
- Students develop their own questions and solve them in their own way
- Concerns: Takes a lot of time, sometimes can become derailed, external factors (meeting curriculum requirements)
- Benefits:  Students are internally motivated, opportunities for collaboration, might involve experts from the community
- It helps to assign jobs to the group
- Sometimes it's appropriate to have one rubric per job
- Average group grade and individual grade
- Students can be scored by other students
- It helps to have a good structure and clear expectations (PBLworks.org)

### Engineering for the Environment - Group Project
- Create a team of environmental engineers who will work together to solve an environmental issue of their choosing
- Identify an ecological/environmental problem to research and problem solve using the Engineering Design Process
- Present your prototype at a Shark Tank Town Hall
- Goals: Increase awareness of environmental issues, identify causes and impacts of environmental issues, investigate how science and technology can be applied to solve real world problems
- Examples of ecological/environmental issues:
-- Decline of amphibians, plastic island, bees disappearing, lightning bugs becoming extinct
-- https://theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/
-- Perhaps consider a local solution which prevents the trash from reaching the ocean in the first place

## Day 3
### Health of an Ecosystem
- 40% of all insect species are in decline
- Bugs are pollinators
- They serve as an important food source
- Populations can be surveyed by netting or pitfall traps or "vacuuming" with an aspirator (Pooter)
- We built pooters out of two tubes, seven rubber bands, and a piece of felt
- We went outside and caught insects in a net and then used the aspirator to trap them in a small plastic container for further observation
- Insects are masters of survival.  
- Cages can be build very cheaply using tupperware and roundvent.com vents.
- Cockroaches "breathe" through spiracles.  With their tarsal pads they're able to climb glass.  They can eat old vegetables or dog food.  
- Striped walking sticks are a great example of camouflage.  They're herbivores.
